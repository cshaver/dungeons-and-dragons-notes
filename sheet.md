**Read Thoughts.** You can use your action to magically read the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of you. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, you can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the your concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) tests made to understand things about it, on Charisma tests made towards influencing it or for the purposes of imitating it. However, if the target suspects your true nature, it may make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 plus your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier. Success causes you to lose all of these benefits save those involving imitating the creature, and the creature becomes aware that you are reading its thoughts.

**Slippery Mind.** You are immune to the charmed condition.

- You gain proficiency in either the Stealth skill or the Deception skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you may double your proficiency bonus.

## Battle stuff
- If you attack a surprised creature, you gain advantage on attack rolls against it and deal an additional 2d6 damage to it with weapon attacks or unarmed strikes during the first round of combat.
- If you take the Attack action during the first round of combat, you may make one additional attack as a bonus action.
