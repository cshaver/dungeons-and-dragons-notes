## Personality stuff
- Something about knowing a person being an ultimate power over them, so not having a personality or identity at all as a way of being safe or powerful
- Like a hermit of the soul
- I was inspired by [the stuff about doppelganger societies](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Doppelganger_(5e_Race)) where they have a lot of trouble maintaining personalities of their own. So there could be some backstory where it's a coping mechanism or something

### Inspiration quotes:

>	I once got "lost in character" for almost a decade, and realizing I wasn't actually the person I thought I was was a very traumatic experience. But it also gave me a newfound sense of empathy for the people I manipulate and imitate.

> A doppelganger? Who, me? That... that can't be right, I... I remember my family and childhood... don't I?

> Those familiar with doppelgangers have claimed that many of them actually have trouble developing personalities of their own, finding it easier to imitate the identities of others or to create "false" personas out of whole cloth. Some doppelgangers have supposedly become "lost in character," going the rest of their lives in one shape and one personality until they remain trapped in it forever and don't even remember who they used to be. Other horror stories talk about creatures slowly realizing they are doppelgangers, with slow, personal dread.

## Class stuff

Ideas:
- Wizard to align with "pursuit of knowledge"
- Warlock: Pact of the Winds:

> The Bleak Cabal encourages its faction members to stare into the heart of madness, to look at the inherent pointlessness of existence and to come away with a better understanding of their place in the world, and its insignificance. This cosmic emptiness gives all Bleakers a fatalistic, dire outlook on life, and leads some to great acts of compassion and understanding. It also leads some to take a pilgrimage to Pandemonium, to experience madness in truth, and to understand what it means to entirely lose control.
>
> Those who embrace the revelations whispered to them on the winds may delve deeper, gaining personal power and knowledge from the whispers of madness that howl around their heads. If they follow this madness, and truly revel in it, they may become warlocks, sworn to follow their insanity wherever it may lead them. These members of the Bleak Cabal have sworn themselves to the Pact of the Winds, and __consider their madness to be their patron__, just as warlocks of fey and fiends and great old ones consider those beings to be their patrons. Though less identified (__the Winds have no names, no qualities, no homes, no personalities__), the Winds are no less real, and apparently no less powerfulâ€¦ and they tend to be much more personal.
>
> **Otherworldly Patron:** The Winds. You have reached an agreement with the swirling chaos of your subconscious: you will not try to control it, and it will give you unprecedented power. You know that your existence is pointless, your every effort for naught in the eyes of eternity, and so you choose to dwell with your madness, becoming its servant. No mere mental illnesses, these profound and supernatural insanities reveal arcane secrets you would not otherwise be able to access, giving you __fresh knowledge from within some alien part of your own mind__. You might willingly dive into the depths of depression, or whirl with the reckless euphoria of mania. You may listen to the voices in your head, name your alternate personalities, or cease to doubt your delusions. You allow your paranoia to rule you, or you make a cold peace with your psychopathic nature. Like all warlocks, however, you are not beholden to your patron, merely its willing servant. In exchange for the knowledge and power your madness occasionally grants you in your moments of clarity, you allow yourself to be seized by it for a time, and perhaps, like any warlock, you face an eventual choice between being enslaved by your patron, and being free with all the power it grants.
