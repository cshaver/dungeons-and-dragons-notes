# Character

## TL;DR
- Secret doppelganger
- Spellcasty person
- [Looks like this guy](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/level-100-mage)

| Level | Race | Class | Name | Alignment |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| 1 | Doppelganger | ??? | ??? | ??? |

## Personality stuff
- Something about knowing a person being an ultimate power over them, so not having a personality or identity at all as a way of being safe or powerful
- Like a hermit of the soul
- I was inspired by [the society bits here](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Doppelganger_(5e_Race)) where they have a lot of trouble maintaining personalities of their own. So there could be some backstory where it's a coping mechanism or something

### Inspiration quotes:

>	I once got "lost in character" for almost a decade, and realizing I wasn't actually the person I thought I was was a very traumatic experience. But it also gave me a newfound sense of empathy for the people I manipulate and imitate.

> A doppelganger? Who, me? That... that can't be right, I... I remember my family and childhood... don't I?

> Those familiar with doppelgangers have claimed that many of them actually have trouble developing personalities of their own, finding it easier to imitate the identities of others or to create "false" personas out of whole cloth. Some doppelgangers have supposedly become "lost in character," going the rest of their lives in one shape and one personality until they remain trapped in it forever and don't even remember who they used to be. Other horror stories talk about creatures slowly realizing they are doppelgangers, with slow, personal dread.
