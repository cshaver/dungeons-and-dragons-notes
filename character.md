  # Character

## TL;DR
- Secretly a doppelganger
- Warlock (potentially multiclassing with Rogue)
- [Looks like this guy](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/level-100-mage)

| Level | Race | Class | Name | Alignment |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| 1 | [Doppelganger](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Doppelganger_(5e_Race)) | Warlock | ??? | LE |

## Current persona

| Level | Race | Class | Name | Alignment |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| 1 | Lightfoot halfling | Warlock | Preem | CN |

## Personality stuff
- Several layers of deception – current form is a disguise (big cloak, mask) on top of a shifted disguise.
- Probably manipulative af
- If at some point the outer disguise (mask etc) is revealed, accidentally or because it serves them some advantage, it's still used as a tool to gain the trust of the group. E.g. "I don't trust people enough to reveal my true self, but I trust you guys so much" but it's really another ruse

## Ideals
- "I am no one, so I can become anyone."
- "It is acceptable to maintain the appearance of relationships with other beings if doing so advances my own goals."

## Bonds
- Maybe wants to get in with Vecna (god of evil secrets) so as to guard their own secret. Maybe kill Vecna, who knows.

## Flaws
- "I am terrified of people discovering my truest self."
- Seeing people as lesser, probably underestimates things easily since people are pawns in their world.
- Just no sense of rhythm whatsoever

## Backstory
- Was probably raised with a non-doppleganger family. At some point fell deep into a persona, whole life. Realizing their true self was a big deal, confided in someone and was betrayed in some way.

- Something about knowing a person being an ultimate power over them, so not having a personality or identity at all as a way of being safe or powerful
- Like a hermit of the soul
- I was inspired by [the stuff about doppelganger societies](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Doppelganger_(5e_Race)) where they have a lot of trouble maintaining personalities of their own. So there could be some backstory where it's a coping mechanism or something

### Inspiration quotes:

- > I once got "lost in character" for almost a decade, and realizing I wasn't actually the person I thought I was was a very traumatic experience. But it also gave me a newfound sense of empathy for the people I manipulate and imitate.
- > A doppelganger? Who, me? That... that can't be right, I... I remember my family and childhood... don't I?
- > Those familiar with doppelgangers have claimed that many of them actually have trouble developing personalities of their own, finding it easier to imitate the identities of others or to create "false" personas out of whole cloth. Some doppelgangers have supposedly become "lost in character," going the rest of their lives in one shape and one personality until they remain trapped in it forever and don't even remember who they used to be. Other horror stories talk about creatures slowly realizing they are doppelgangers, with slow, personal dread.


## Race - Doppelganger

> *A deceitful race of shapeshifting hedonists, with quick reflexes and strange outlooks.*
>
> **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.
>
> **Age.** Doppelgangers live until partway through their second century after "coming of age," but become mature at the age their parent race does.
>
> **Alignment.** The majority of doppelgangers are neutral, being self-centered but not truly malicious. Those who favor long-term covers tend to be more lawful, those who like changing very frequently are more chaotic. Those who have become "lost in character" can be of any alignment.
>
> **Size.** In their natural forms, doppelgangers are built like elves, tall and slight. Your size is medium.
>
> **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
>
> **Shapechanger.** You may use your action to polymorph into a humanoid of Small or Medium size, or back into your true form. If you choose, it may be a creature you have seen. Your statistics are not changed by this transformation, and any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. If you die while polymorphed, you return to your true form.
>
> **Read Thoughts.** You can use your action to magically read the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of you. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, you can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the your concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) tests made to understand things about it, on Charisma tests made towards influencing it or for the purposes of imitating it. However, if the target suspects your true nature, it may make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 plus your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier. Success causes you to lose all of these benefits save those involving imitating the creature, and the creature becomes aware that you are reading its thoughts.
>
> **Slippery Mind.** You are immune to the charmed condition.
>
> **Manipulator.** You are proficient in either the Insight or Deception skill.
>
> **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and two other language of your choice.

## Class - Warlock

### Patron:
- The Archfey
  - Could really be manipulating their Patron. Just need an in with a tricksy god as a source of power until they can properly infiltrate Vecna's cults or something.
  - Or, the Archfey patron finds this whole doppelganger thing entertaining as heck. Lies to them, tells them they're really a faerie and gives them powers to watch them "go do fun stuff"
- Potentially pretending to be **Pact of the Winds**:
    > ### WARLOCK: Pact of The Winds
    > The Bleak Cabal encourages its faction members to stare into the heart of madness, to look at the inherent pointlessness of existence and to come away with a better understanding of their place in the world, and its insignificance. This cosmic emptiness gives all Bleakers a fatalistic, dire outlook on life, and leads some to great acts of compassion and understanding. It also leads some to take a pilgrimage to Pandemonium, to experience madness in truth, and to understand what it means to entirely lose control.
    > Those who embrace the revelations whispered to them on the winds may delve deeper, gaining personal power and knowledge from the whispers of madness that howl around their heads. If they follow this madness, and truly revel in it, they may become warlocks, sworn to follow their insanity wherever it may lead them. These members of the Bleak Cabal have sworn themselves to the Pact of the Winds, and __consider their madness to be their patron__, just as warlocks of fey and fiends and great old ones consider those beings to be their patrons. Though less identified (__the Winds have no names, no qualities, no homes, no personalities__), the Winds are no less real, and apparently no less powerful… and they tend to be much more personal.
    >
    > **Otherworldly Patron:** The Winds. You have reached an agreement with the swirling chaos of your subconscious: you will not try to control it, and it will give you unprecedented power. You know that your existence is pointless, your every effort for naught in the eyes of eternity, and so you choose to dwell with your madness, becoming its servant. No mere mental illnesses, these profound and supernatural insanities reveal arcane secrets you would not otherwise be able to access, giving you __fresh knowledge from within some alien part of your own mind__. You might willingly dive into the depths of depression, or whirl with the reckless euphoria of mania. You may listen to the voices in your head, name your alternate personalities, or cease to doubt your delusions. You allow your paranoia to rule you, or you make a cold peace with your psychopathic nature. Like all warlocks, however, you are not beholden to your patron, merely its willing servant. In exchange for the knowledge and power your madness occasionally grants you in your moments of clarity, you allow yourself to be seized by it for a time, and perhaps, like any warlock, you face an eventual choice between being enslaved by your patron, and being free with all the power it grants.

## Other allegiances
- Potential factions, (a goal could be to infiltrate multiple factions), but maybe pretending to be in:
  > ### BLEAK CABAL “BLEAKER”
  > The multiverse ain't supposed to make sense; there's no grand scheme, no deep meaning, no elusive order. The only truth worth finding lies within. You are a member of the Bleak Cabal. Your central belief is that there is no greater meaning to anyone’s life, and that the only meaning we can derive from existence comes from what we can do for those around us now. Prerequisite: Lawful characters don't join the Bleak Cabal because a life without meaning means a life without order. Skill
  >
  > **Proficiencies:** Insight, medicine Tool Proficiency: Herbalism kit, cook's utensils Equipment: Herbalism kit, healer’s kit, manacles, a set of common clothes with a faction badge sewn into them, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp. Feature: Nameless. As a Bleaker, you’ve given up your last name, seeing family ties as meaningless. You are welcome to stay in the Mad Bleaker wing of the Gatehouse in the Hive Ward, and you are also welcome to work at a particular soup kitchen somewhere in the Hive or in one of the Gatehouse wings (though you aren’t paid for this). Additionally, you know of a portal, and the key for that portal, that leads to the town of The Madhouse in Pandemonium, where you are also welcome. Inspiration: Reassurance in the Face of Oblivion. If you gain a point of Inspiration for adhering to your faction philosophy, you may use it to allow an ally (someone other than yourself) to automatically succeed on a save against any effect that requires a Wisdom saving throw.
  > Actions that may earn you Inspiration might include:
  > - Accepting only practical, tangible rewards for services rendered, while disdaining the accolades and/or social boons typically associated with heroic endeavors.
  > - Voluntarily failing a save against an effect that induces madness or affects the mind.
  > - Aid the suffering of others without expectation of compensation or reward. Restriction: After each week of downtime you must pass of DC10 Wisdom saving throw or succumb to temporary “Bleaker madness” which lasts either until your downtime period ends or after 1d6+1 days pass, whichever comes first. During this madness you cannot take any activities (downtime activities or otherwise) besides resting; if you do you cannot gain  46 Inspiration until you atone or otherwise prove yourself to your faction's cause (or lack thereof!).
  >
  > **Suggested Characteristics:** Bleakers can be dour and most are more than a little insane, but the best of them are charitable and generous, finding that alleviating the suffering is a lot more useful than looking for a point to it.
  >
  > **Bleaker Membership:** Members of the Cabal are surprisingly diverse, but they share one common theme: any devotion to a cause greater than one's own life is seen as entirely pointless, so classes that revere distant concepts or entities are very unusual. The Bleakers enjoy plenty of hardened sellswords (half-mad berserker barbarians, fighters inured to violence, cold-blooded assassins), and some dangerous and unpredictable spell-slingers (wild sorcerers who have lost touch with reality, madness-inducing enchanters, illusionists who view life as fleeting as illusions).
  > Warlocks earn a special mention, for while most of the pacts are common enough (a Bleaker doesn't think much about selling his soul to Baphomet because they know that Baphomet's life, too, will eventually end with pain and suffering too), certain Bleaker warlocks who have been exposed to the winds of Pandemonium accept the Pact of the Winds. This pact enables them to channel the madness of that dark, cold place into their own minds. While they resemble warlocks dedicated to the Great Old Ones in several ways, a telling difference is that the creatures beyond the stars want to control minds, but the Winds just want to tear 'em to shreds.
  > There aren't many paladins, clerics, druids, bards, or monks among the Cabal, as those classes tend to be focused on certain “higher callings” that render most Bleakers unsuitable for their roles. Still, the occasional paladin of Devotion might swear himself to anonymously help others, and a certain group of entertainers known as the Bleakniks might someday give rise to a true (and truly awful) bardic College.

- Could fit with actual character:
  - > ### THE FATED “TAKER”
    > *The multiverse belongs to those who seize it. No ones to blame for a poor sod's fate but the sorry sod himself.*
    > You are a member of the Fated. You belong to a group of independent, self-sufficient people who ally because they share the view that the authority in life belongs to those who can seize it.
    >
    > **Prerequisite:** Lawful Good characters avoid the Fated's uncharitable philosophy.
    >
    > **Skill Proficiencies:** Intimidation, investigation
    >
    > **Tool Proficiency:** Scribe’s supplies, forgery kit
    >
    > **Equipment:** Scribe’s supplies, forgery kit, a set of fine clothes including a faction badge sewn into them, and a belt pouch containing 25 gp.
    > Feature: Heartless. As a member of the Fated, you have access to the Hall of Records, including food and drink for a reasonable fee (Fated get nothing for free), and access to the property records, the Academy of Training, and the tax records of Sigil (including defaults, credits, lending records, tax rolls – anything having to do with money). Perhaps importantly, you also know how to look up records yourself. You also know the key to and location of a portal that will grant you access to Rowan's Hall on Ysgard.
    >
    > **Inspiration:** Self-Sufficient. If you gain a point of Inspiration for adhering to your faction philosophy, you may use it to gain a proficiency bonus to one skill check that you make in a skill you aren’t normally proficient in.
    > The following examples may be situations in which you are awarded Inspiration:
    > - Refusing healing or assistive magic from another character.
    > - Accomplishing a deed (such as slaying a monster) without any other character contributing.
    > - Refusing to help an ally in desperate need.
    >
    > **Restriction:** A real Taker doesn't accept or give charity, always demands (or provides) services before payment is rendered, and strives toward self-reliance; should you compromise these core values, you lose the ability to gain Inspiration until you atone or otherwise prove yourself to your faction's cause.
    >
    > **Suggested Characteristics:** The Fated are self-sufficient, independent, and harsh in their treatment of others, but fair. The strong get what they deserve, but there are many kinds of strength in this world, many much more subtle than raw muscle.
    >
    > **Taker Membership:** The Fated are entirely a group of survivalists of one stripe or another. The faction attracts any member of any class that doesn't depend on others to get their job done. Barbarians, fighters, druids, rangers (hunter rangers are more popular than beastmaster rangers), and sorcerers are very common, each one capable of mastering their own power. More urban environments lead to a lot of rogues, especially Digger Archetype rogues, each one a master at discovering secrets that others want to keep hidden. More rarely, you may find Fated paladins, monks, wizards, or bards. These classes tend to rely on others, at least for their initial training, but some certainly take a more independent view of their abilities, and become self-taught and self-guided, though this path is often difficult for them. Clerics and Warlocks, explicitly dependent as they are on other entities, almost never become Takers, who see both classes as being crippled by their reliance on the charity of some other creature, little more than parasites on them.
    - > ### FRATERNITY OF ORDER “GUVNER”
    > *Everything has laws; most are dark. Learn the laws of the multiverse, and you can control it.*
    > You are a member of the Fraternity of Order. You believe that all of creation has a hidden pattern and cohesiveness, and that by discovering this pattern, you can attain power over it.
    >
    > **Prerequisite:** Only Lawful-aligned characters can join the faction.
    >
    > **Skill Proficiencies:** History, investigation
    >
    > **Tool Proficiency:** Cartographer’s tools, scribe's supplies
    >
    > **Equipment:** Cartographer’s tools, scribe’s supplies, abacus, a set of common clothes including a faction badge sewn into them, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp.
    >
    > **Feature:** Aide to Unity. You belong to the Fraternity of order, which allows you to access the City Court and the Vault of Knowledge that lies there. You may be assigned tasks by the faction and make some coin – enough to live a Modest lifestyle. You also know of a portal to the Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment, the Fraternity’s headquarters on Mechanus, and the key to that portal.
    >
    > **Inspiration:** Patterns of Speech. If you gain a point of Inspiration for adhering to your faction philosophy, you may use it to understand one bit information spoken or written in a language you are not otherwise fluent in. In addition, you can spend Inspiration when casting comprehend languages to decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane Sigil, that isn't part of a written language. Actions you might take that may gain you
    > Inspiration might include:
    > - Spending your down time accessing and learning about the laws of the area you're in.
    > - Adhering to the law of the land when breaking it would bring you some reward or convenience.
    > - Exploiting or correcting a loophole in a legal system.
    >
    > **Suggested Characteristics:** Guvners are attracted to power. Though the faction’s daily activities are dry and even dull, the stakes are quite high – if the Guvners are right, then sufficient study will allow one to control the underpinning axioms of reality.
