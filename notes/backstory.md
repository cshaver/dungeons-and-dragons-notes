# Backstory

- Previously was in form of human town sheriff **Anders**. Family: wife **Ifalna** and young daughter **Elsie**
- Tortured bandits for information and justice reasons
- Rumors of strange happenings in local swamp
- Tortured bandits offer little to no info. In the middle of a torture session, part of Anders' arm twinges, turns grayish (shift-back). Freaks out a bit, bandit dies after uttering a cryptic message.
- Intrusive thought - "humans are weak"
- Seeing wife again seems forced, part of face shifts back and wife freaks out.
- Feels compelled to go to swamp.
- Drawn to the hags hut. Body shape barely holding it together.
- Hag might be offering some vague explanations. Looking for another pawn. Manipulative but "motherly"
- She snaps her fingers and Anders immediately shifts to true doppelganger form.
- Hag presents **Nul** with a form to mimmick - halfling either dead or near-death. No identity to glean, causing more confusion + identity issues. Hence no name, obscuring face, etc. This feels pretty violating, but with nowhere else to go (family has disappeared - unknown if of their own volition or the hagâ€™s doing) Nul takes the hag **Norhilda** as their warlock patron.
- "gumdrop" form: Lightfoot halfling, Arcane researcher, was researching Sigil from a library in Faerun at the hag's behest
