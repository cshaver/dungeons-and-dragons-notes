The rules for passive checks can be found on PH page 175, left- hand column. A character's passive score is 10 + all modifiers that normally apply. Â±5 if you have advantage/disadvantage.

- You gain proficiency in either the Stealth skill or the Deception skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you may double your proficiency bonus.
- If you attack a surprised creature, you gain advantage on attack rolls against it and deal an additional 2d6 damage to it with weapon attacks or unarmed strikes during the first round of combat.
- If you take the Attack action during the first round of combat, you may make one additional attack as a bonus action.

So let's go with the 5e monster manual way for reading thoughts. You get advantage on wisdom(insight), Charisma (deception, intimidation, persuasion) while concentrating, and you have a racial proficiency in these skills:

> The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's Concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.

- racial proficiency in all char statistics
- Fuck it. You get all humanoid shapes for free
- Anything in the book that is humanoid you already know, you don't have to learn new shapes. But we could talk if you want to learn fleshy monstrous bipedal small-medium shapes like vampires, minotaurs, mind flayers, angels

There is also Mask the god of thieves. Rumor has it he's trying to get deception back into his portfolio after Cyric stole it. Also no one knows his true face, He's faerun

But a lich god is full of fun
And it looks like vecna was betrayed by his last side kick
